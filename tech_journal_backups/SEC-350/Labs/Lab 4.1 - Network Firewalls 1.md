# Reflection

I have learned a lot in the past 2 weeks in SEC-350. Last week, I worked a lot in and created documentation about [Wazuh.](https://github.com/Oliver-Mustoe/Oliver-Mustoe-Tech-Journal/wiki/Wazuh-reference) I like Wazuh, it has a simple to use gui but I sense could be used pretty well if you knew how to use the command line interfaces. So far, we have only used it for logging bad logins. I am overall excited to see what it can do in more serious circumstances. Using [VyOS](https://github.com/Oliver-Mustoe/Oliver-Mustoe-Tech-Journal/wiki/Vyos-reference), specifically as a firewall, has also been an interesting experience. It is very similar to activities I have done in a 300 level networking class, so it was easy to wrap my mind around it thinking like that. I still need to spend some time with the firewalls to really understand/be able to build them without any sort of guide. I have enjoyed these past 2 weeks, and I am looking forward to letting the firewall knowledge seep into my brain!
